    <h1>Tiger</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The <a href="no where">tiger</a> (Panthera tigris) is a member of the genus Panthera and the largest living cat
        species native to Asia.
        It has a powerful, muscular body with a large head and paws, a long tail and orange fur with black, mostly
        vertical stripes. It is traditionally classified into nine recent subspecies, though some recognise only two
        subspecies, mainland Asian tigers and the island tigers of the Sunda Islands.</p>
    <p>Throughout the tiger's range, it inhabits mainly forests, from coniferous and temperate broadleaf and mixed
        forests in the Russian Far East and Northeast China to tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests on the
        Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The tiger is an apex predator and preys mainly on ungulates such as deer
        and wild boar, which it takes by ambush.</p>


    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The Old English tigras derives from Old French tigre, from Latin tigris, which was a borrowing from Classical
        Greek τίγρις 'tigris'.[4] Since ancient times, the word tigris has been suggested to originate from the Armenian
        or Persian word for 'arrow', which may also be the origin of the name for the river Tigris.</p>
    <p> However, today, the connection between the animal and the river is doubted and they are likely to be
        homonyms.[6]</p>

    <h3>Evolution</h3>
    <p>The tiger shares the genus Panthera with the lion, leopard, jaguar and snow leopard. Results of genetic analyses
        indicate that the tiger and snow leopard are sister species whose lineages split from each other between 2.70
        and 3.70 million years ago.[37] The tiger's whole genome sequencing shows repeated sequences that parallel those
        in other cat genomes.[38]</p>

    <h3>Subspecies</h3>
    <p>Nine recent tiger subspecies have been proposed between the early 19th and early 21st centuries, namely the
        Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South China, Siberian, Caspian, Javan, Bali and Sumatran tigers.[9][10] The
        validity of several tiger subspecies was questioned in 1999 as most putative subspecies were distinguished on
        the basis of fur length and colouration, striping patterns and body size of specimens in natural history museum
        collections that are not necessarily representative for the entire population.</p>

    <h2>Distribution and habitat</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The tiger historically ranged from eastern Turkey, northern Iran and Afghanistan to Central Asia and from
        northern Pakistan through the Indian subcontinent and Indochina to southeastern Siberia, Sumatra, Java and Bali.
