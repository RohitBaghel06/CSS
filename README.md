# CSS
This is my CSS Git repository.


## CSS Style Types
- The three types of CSS are external, internal, and inline. 
- External CSS is a file that HTML files will link to.
- Internal CSS is specified at the beginning of an HTML document.
- Inline CSS is written for a specific element in the HTML document.


## CSS Color Properties
- The color CSS property sets the foreground color value of an element's text and text decorations, and sets the currentcolor value.
- There are five types of Color properties in the css
- ColorName, rgb, hsl, hsla #VALUE, hwb
```
h1 {
    color: rebeccapurple;
}
h2 {
    color: #00a400;
}
color: rgb(214, 122, 127);
color: hsl(30deg 82% 43%);
color: hsla(237deg 74% 33% / 61%);
color: hwb(152deg 0% 58% / 70%);
```


## CSS Text Properties
- Text properties allow you to control everything from the appearance and position of text, to resizing behavior and OpenType features.
- text-align, font-weight, text-decoration, line-height, letter spreading, etc.
